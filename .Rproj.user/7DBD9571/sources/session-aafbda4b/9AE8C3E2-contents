This study included two .py files.
‘final_jiawen_shi_1.py’ is used to clean the dataset.
‘final_jiawen_shi_2.py’ is used to analyse the dataset.
‘HIV_AIDS_Diagnoses_by_Neighborhood__Sex__and_Race_Ethnicity.csv’ is the original (or raw) dataset.
‘cleaned_data.csv’ is the dataset cleaned by the first .py program.

If you only wish to see the analytical results, you can simply use the second .py file and import the ‘cleaned_data.csv’.
